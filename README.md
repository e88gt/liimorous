a dungeon crawler game

some rules for writing the code:

* naming convention:
    * classes: PascalCase
    * static final fields: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
    * fields: camelCase
    * methods: camelCase

* inheritance:
    * subclasses can implement superinterface but they cant extend any superclass
    * all classes must be final

* staticity:
    * no methods (except the main method) can be static
